I'll create a new React application for visualizing neural networks with forward propagation. This will demonstrate how neural networks process environmental data to make predictions.

First, let me create a directory for this project and set up a React application:

markdown
CopyInsert
1. Create a project directory
2. Initialize a React application with create-react-app
3. Add necessary dependencies for neural network visualization
4. Create components for the neural network visualization
5. Implement forward propagation simulation
6. Add environmental data input and prediction display
Let's start by creating the project directory and initializing the React application:

Ran terminal command
C:\Users\dasat > mkdir -p C:\Users\dasat\CascadeProjects\neural-network-visualizer

Clicking this will open the associated terminal session in Windsurf.

Now I'll initialize the React application using create-react-app:

Ran terminal command
…\neural-network-visualizer > npx create-react-app .















                                                             npx create-react-app .

I'll create a neural network visualization component that draws the specified architecture using SVG. Since I see you already have D3.js in your dependencies, I'll use it to help with the visualization.

Add the ability to display weight values on the connections between neurons when the user hovers over them.Add the ability to display weight values on the connections between neurons when the user hovers over them. Implement a step-by-step visualization of forward propagation. Show how the input values propagate through the network with animations highlighting the active connections and nodes. Create a function that calculates the weighted sum for each neuron and displays the calculation steps in a sidebar.Add an input form where users can enter environmental data values (like temperature, humidity, etc.) for the neural network to process. Include a feature that lets users choose from preset sample data representing different environmental scenarios. Create a results panel that shows the prediction output and explains how each input contributed to the final prediction.  Add visualizations that show the relative importance of each input feature using bar charts or radar plots.

I'll implement these features one by one. Let's start with adding hover functionality to display weights on connections and then continue with the other features.
